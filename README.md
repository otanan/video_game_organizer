# Video Game Organizer

A video game organizer that stores video game information as JSON data which in theory could be read by any JSON reader. However, the GUI provided by this program provides an intuitive way of viewing a list of owned video games, and organizing them.

## Getting Started

Currently implementing using the GUI to create the JSON data of stored video games.
